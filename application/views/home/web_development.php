			<h4>We make websites that work fantatic !</h4>
			<p>
				Having a website is only part of starting. It needs to be developed. It needs to be professionally developed. But most importantly, it needs to work. We provides web development services to businesses of all sizes.

PwaOptimizer focuses on not only providing web development, but on functions that give your clients the information they need - the oh-so-important first impression of your organization or business, the services you provide, or about the book you just published.

					<span>Development</span>
					<p>Once you've signed off on your design, it's time to code! We'll take your completed concept and turn it into a working website. Once completed, we'll provide you with a private URL for previewing and testing your new site. This gives you the opportunity to test it on all your devices, check that all the links and buttons work, and make sure you like the images and content layout. We have version control system with Github so we can flip between works</p>

					<span>Content</span>
					<p>A website isn't complete until every page has enough content (500 words per page). We hope that you've been working hard to have content ready for website. Your customers have come to the website for a reason, so you want to be sure you've answered all their questions! Content is crucial to every website.

					We'll take your content and lay it out on each page so that it looks great and is easy to read.</p>
